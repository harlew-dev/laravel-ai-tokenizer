# Contributing

Contributions are welcome and will be fully credited.

We accept contributions via Pull Requests on [GitHub](https://github.com/harlew-dev/laravel-ai-tokenizer).

## Pull Requests

- **[PSR-12 Coding Standard](https://www.php-fig.org/psr/psr-12/)** - Check the code style with `composer pint`.
- **Add tests!** - Your patch won't be accepted if it doesn't have tests.
- **Document any change in behaviour** - Make sure the `README.md` and any other relevant documentation are kept up-to-date.
- **Consider our release cycle** - We try to follow [SemVer v2.0.0](https://semver.org/). Randomly breaking public APIs is not an option.
- **Create feature branches** - Don't ask us to pull from your main branch.
- **One pull request per feature** - If you want to do more than one thing, send multiple pull requests.
